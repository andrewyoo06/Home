			<!-- Introduction to the page, and the style of music I listen to and why.-->
			<p class="contentcell" >
			    Growing up in a Korean household, I was constantly exposed to South Korean Culture. 
				So even when I was kid, I was always surronded by korean music. Korean music was
				what was always playing in the car, or at home. Inevitablity, I grew up 
				listening and still listen to a lot of korean songs. Korean music is a vast area of music
				that includes everything from kpop groups with fancy cheorgraphies to solo artists
				with amazing ballads to amazing rappers. Also, as a result of being at home for so long 
				due to COVID-19, I've had a lot of spare time to discover new songs and listen to more 
				songs. Currently my favourite artists are IU (female solo artist), iKON(boy group, with 
				some of most favourite rappers and singers), and BTS (the biggest boy group on the planet!), 
				Also please keep in mind, if you are not accessing this through the github website, some 
				of the music videos may be blocked so you can just click view in Youtube and this should 
				solve the problem!

			<!-- Paragraph on IU-->
			<p class="contentcell_2">
				<b>IU</b> is one of the most liked people in all of South Korea. She was known as the nation's 
				"little sister", for her likeable looks and personality. IU is recognized for her outstanding
				singing ability, acting skills, looks, along with so much more! Personally, I remember seeing her
				in my childhood, on TV a lot(Variety & Music Shows). She has been one of my favourite artists for an 
				incredible ammount of time, and below I have included two of my favourite songs from her. The first
				song is called ÎπÑÎ∞ÄÏùò ÌôîÏõê or "Secret Garden" in english. The song is a remake from her "Sleepless Rainy 
				Night" album. As for the second song, it is a collabaration with Suga the famous rapper, from BTS, and 
				this is probably one of her more popular songs. I recommend listening to her if you are into more softer, 
				ballad-style songs. I use her songs primarily to study, sleep or really anywhere when I want to be comfortable.

			<!-- Paragraph on iKON-->
			<p class="contentcell_3">
				<b>iKON</b> is a group produced by YG Entertainment, that debuted in 2015, as a mainly hip-hop based 
				group. They are known for their hits "Love Scenario"(This song was so addictive, and popular in Korea, 
				that in classrooms, kids were singing it so much it got banned üòÇ), "My Type", among other hits. I have 
				been a fan of this group since their debut. Also, I particularily, like the rappers that were and still in the group.
				Kim Hanbin (B.I), the former leader and Bobby (Known for his rapping, singing and producing skills) are some of my favourite rappers. 
				iKON is an incredibly talented group with a lot of hits. They are capable of any concept, and style of music. They 
				have rap songs, ballad songs, and even dance songs. I will be showing you 3 songs, that I highly recommend
				everyone should listen to. The first is called "Waterfall", by the former leader B.I. This is an emotional rap song,
				which lyrics describe the pain B.I. felt during his scandal and departure from the group. There is also a preformance
				version of the song where he shows off his dance moves, and is a must watch if you like this song. The second song, is one 
				of the legendary songs by iKON, Love Scenario. It's one multiple song of the year awards, and really blew up everywhere.
				The third song, is a more chill type of song that is titled "Freedom".

			<!-- Paragraph on BTS-->
			<p class="contentcell_4">
				<b>BTS</b> is a name that every one knows, whether its because they are a fan or simple because everyone
				keeps on talking about them. They are the biggest boy group in the world! They were orignally supposed to debut as a 
				hip-hop group and have showed other musical sides to them as the years have gone by. They consist of 4 vocalists and 
				3 rappers, which are all incredibly talented. However in my opinion, their english releases, "Dynamite" and "Butter", are
				just not as good as their previous releases. These are "ok" songs but it does not show how skilled BTS is in terms
				of dancing, rapping or singing. Sadly these are their most popular songs and many people do not realize the other
				musical side of BTS. So today I will not be showing you those songs,I will be showing you these 3 diffrent songs. 
				They will each show-case a diffrent side of BTS.
				For the first song, it is called "Mic Drop", by BTS. This song calls out the people who didn't beleive in them or
				simply are "hating" on them. Also, if you want to see more songs that are just 100% rap, check out the Cypher 
				series or the solo works of RM, Suga, and J-Hope. Next, is a song called "ON". This is one of the most advanced 
				songs in terms of dancing. There is so much complex forms of dancing and they have filmed and sang this song 
				in many places, but in my opinion their preformance at the Grand Central Station in New York was their best. Lastly, 
				is my favourite BTS song, called "Life Goes On". This song really struck a chord with me as this was realised in quarantine
				and the lyrics describe the endless waiting, and how life still goes on. All of their songs are good and BTS has something
				for everyone, whether it be ballads or rap!

			<!-- Final Paragraph to summarize things for this page-->
			<p class="contentcell_5">

				There are also so many artists I could not include but listen to. There are so many good artists out their and here 
				is a few I also enjoy: Epik High, ITZY, aespa, and just so much more!(SNSD, BIGBANG childhood memories:)
