				<b>Hockey:</b>
				I have been a fan of hockey for almost my whole life now. I originally began skating at a 
				very young age, when I was around 6 years old. I enjoyed skating but one day, my dad introduced 
				me to the sport of hockey! I watched hockey on TV for the first time, and the team I was watching
				was the Toronto Maple Leafs! On top of cheering for the Maple Leafs, I also played hockey and 
				still do, despite COVID-19, ruining the season last year. On the left you can see a picture of 
				my jerseys with my name, which I wear while playing for the Willowdale Blackhawks
			</p>
			<!-- Paragraph on Track-->
			<p class="contentcell_3">
				<b> Track: </b> 
				Since a young age, I've always liked running, and still do it to calm me down or for exercise on 
				a daily basis. I have represented my schools in the 400 metres, 800 metres, and cross country races
				for a while now. I do prefer long distances over short distance running as I like to pace myself and 
				find it easier than bursts of speed. Long distance running is a lot more fun in my opinion. I often
				go for runs at sunrise or near sunset to start or end days. Running is a lot more fun that you may
				think!
			<p>
			<!-- Paragraph on Badminton-->
			<p class="contentcell_4">
				<b>Badminton:</b>
				 Badminton is an activity I do for fun,and I have grown up playing this outside with family and friends. 
				 I enjoy all sorts of racket games with tennis being the one I'm best at. Badminton is easy to set up and 
				 playable nearly anywhere and is just a good fun game that I enjoy playing!
